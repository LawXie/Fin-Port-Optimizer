# Portfolio Optimizer
Compare effectiveness of an equal weight strategy and how to improve through stock selection

<<<<<<< HEAD
## Introduction
This project utilizes the financial portfolio metrics of returns and variance as well as the Modern Portfolio Theory (MDT). 
  - Given a list of stocks, it calculates the equal weight porfolio for variance and returns. 
  - Makes a random sample of 10,000 portfolios of varing weights and graphs a portfolio efficient frontier.
      - Markers are optimal returns porfolio (highest Sharpe Ratio), mininum variance portfolio, and equal weighted porfolio. 
  - Returns are dividend adjusted by adding to the closing price of dividend ex-date and all closing prices following.

## Summary
This project utilizes the financial portfolio metrics of returns and variance as well as the Modern Portfolio Theory (MDT). Given a list of stock, it calculates the equal weight porfolio variance and returns of portfolio. The project then makes a sample of 10,000 random sample portfolios of varing weights and graphs a portfolio effective frontier graph that also includes the ploted points of optimal returns porfolio (highest Sharpe Ratio), mininum variance portfolio, and equal weighted porfolio. Returns are dividend adjusted by adding to the closing price of dividend ex-date and all closing prices after.
